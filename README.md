# ICU_Finder
A distributed database management system project. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was hard to find ICU. The nearest vacant ICU can be found from the patient's GPS location using different servers. Oracle SQL *plus was used and the language was PL SQL. GPS distance was calculated by the Haversine formula.
